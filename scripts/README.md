# Training

Edit the defaults at the top of `scripts/train.py` (especially `DATA_ROOT` and
`SCENES`), then run `python scripts/train.py`. Or provide settings as arguments:

```bash
python scripts/train.py --data-root /path/to/scenes --scenes scan65 scan69 \
  --output-root output --name baseline --gpu 0 --iterations 30000
```

The launcher trains scenes sequentially, with outputs in
`OUTPUT_ROOT/SCENE/NAME`. It uses the active Python environment and the native
`train.py` implementation. The scene must have a COLMAP `sparse/0` or `sparse` model and
images, or a supported NeRF synthetic dataset. Use `--dry-run` to check the
commands, and `--help` for options.

Scenes may be nested paths relative to `--data-root`, such as
`--scenes orange_4F/1_full`; this preserves that path under the output root.
If `--data-root` itself is a scene, use `--scenes .`; its folder name is used
as the output scene name.

Pass additional native options after `--`:

```bash
python scripts/train.py --scenes scan65 -- --antialiasing
```

The launcher refuses to use a nonempty output directory unless
`--allow-existing` is specified; that option does not resume training by
itself. Native `--start_checkpoint` is required to resume a checkpoint.

## Keyframe selection

Add `--select-keyframes` to score registered COLMAP training images in natural
filename order and keep the sharpest per three consecutive images (or set
`SELECT_KEYFRAMES = True` at the top of the launcher). Change the group size
with `--keyframe-group-size`. The score is full-resolution grayscale Laplacian
variance; ties go to the first frame. The final incomplete group is included.

With `--eval`, the native lexicographic 1-in-8 test split is held out first;
only the remaining training images are grouped, and test cameras stay intact.
The chosen names, every candidate's score and settings are written to
`OUTPUT_ROOT/SCENE/NAME/keyframes.json` before training. The selection does not
change the input images or COLMAP model. The original 3DGS point-cloud cache
behavior is unchanged.

Use `--selection-only` together with `--select-keyframes` to select without
training. To train afterwards, run the same command without `--selection-only`
and add `--allow-existing`; the existing matching manifest is reused. The
option currently supports COLMAP scenes, not NeRF synthetic scenes.
